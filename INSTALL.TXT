This code was made using Python3 in a linux environment.

I have no idea how much experience you have with Python3, so I'll err on the side of caution and be overly detailed!

I'll assume you have a linux environment available.

If you don't have python3 installed, you can install it with: sudo apt-get install python3


***************************
Setup a virtual environment (optional)
***************************

Not strictly necessary, but it'll ensure that everything is contained and won't affect your general linux environment.
This is done via 'venv', which should be included automatically in your Python3 install

To setup to the environment, run: python3 -m venv <path to directory>
For example, if you're in the directory you want to be the root directory of the environment, run: python3 -m venv ./
This will setup the environment but not run it.

To run the environment, run: source bin/activate
You'll know it's working if new lines in the terminal start with text in parenthesis before the usual command-line text
The text is the name of the environment, which is usually the name of the root directory of the environment

When you're done, you can just close the terminal, but if you decide you need to deactivate the environment, just run: deactivate


***************************
Install requirements
***************************

The program requires a few libraries, listed in the requirements.txt file

To install them, just run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a Google Client
***************************

We'll need to register the app as a client to Google.

Go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and login.
Once logged in, you can create a project. The name can be whatever you want.
In the left menu, select Credentials. There should then be a "create credentials" button near the top of the page.
Click "create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID"

If you haven't used this service before, it'll take you to the OAuth consent screen.
Just follow directions. The only thing I think is likely to be important is scopes;
make sure ./auth/userinfo.email, openid, and ./auth/userinfo.profile are all added
(They should be at the top when you click "add or remove scopes")
When done, you might need to go back to Credentials and click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth client ID" again (I forget)

For "application type", select "web application"
Under authorized JavaScript origins, add: https://127.0.0.1:5000
Under authorized redirect URIs, add: https://127.0.0.1:5000/login/callback
Click save. It'll then display a Client ID string and Client secret string. Save both of these!


***************************
Set environment variables
***************************

Next, we need to set the Client ID and Client secret as environmental variables that the program can read.
If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated.
Then run the following commands:

export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=client_id
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret

where client_id and client_secret are the strings you got in the previous step.


***************************
Run it
***************************

From the directory holding app.py, run: python3 app.py

The program will run until forced close. Just hit CTRL+C to close it.
