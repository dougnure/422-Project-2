This code was made using Python3 in a linux environment.

I have no idea how much experience you have with Python3, so I'll err on the side of caution and be overly detailed!

I'll assume you have a linux environment available.

If you don't have python3 installed, you can install it with: sudo apt-get install python3


***************************
Setup a virtual environment (optional)
***************************

Not strictly necessary, but it'll ensure that everything is contained and won't affect your general linux environment.
This is done via 'venv', which should be included automatically in your Python3 install

To setup to the environment, run: python3 -m venv <path to directory>
For example, if you're in the directory you want to be the root directory of the environment, run: python3 -m venv ./
This will setup the environment but not run it.

To run the environment, run: source bin/activate
You'll know it's working if new lines in the terminal start with text in parenthesis before the usual command-line text
The text is the name of the environment, which is usually the name of the root directory of the environment

When you're done, you can just close the terminal, but if you decide you need to deactivate the environment, just run: deactivate


***************************
Install requirements
***************************

The program requires a few libraries, listed in the requirements.txt file

To install them, just run: pip install -r requirements.txt


***************************
Run it
***************************

From the directory holding app.py, run: python3 app.py

The program will run until forced close. Just hit CTRL+C to close it.
